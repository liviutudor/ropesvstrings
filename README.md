Java Ropes vs Strings comparison.

Few tests meant to compare a Java Ropes implementation (see http://ahmadsoft.org/ropes/) versus the standard JDK `String`
and `StringBuilder`.

It runs the following types of tests:

* create
* concatenate character
* concatenate string
* search substring

The original blog post for this can be found on my blog here: http://liviutudor.com/2014/02/04/java-strings-vs-ropes/ 
together with the results for it.
